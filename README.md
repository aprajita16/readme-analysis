# Task extraction## Running the code while developingFrom the `TaskParser` directory, run:    mvn compile    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.tutorons.packagesearch.TaskParser" -Dexec.args="postgres-config.json"The only part of the above set of commands that you might need to change is `postgres-config.json`.`postgres-config.json` is a JSON configuration file describing how to connect to the database.It includes these keys: `dbusername`, `dbpassword`, `host`, and `database`.Most of these keys are self-explanatory.`host` is the URL of the machine where the database is hosted.`database` is the name of the database.## Building the projectTo build the project:    mvn installThis builds a version of the project that includes all dependencies at the file named `task-parser-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.Don't forget to upload the result to S3 when a new version is created.When you do this, also update the `task-parser-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file, which does not have a version in its name.This should be kept up to date as the most recent version of the task parser archive.## Running the JAR fileThen you can run the result with:    java -jar task-parser-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar postgres-config.json`version` is the version of the build of the task parser.
